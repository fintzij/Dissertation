\label{subsec:lna_coverage_setup_details}

In this simulation, repeated for each of the three different regimes of population size and initial conditions given in Table \ref{tab:lna_coverage_sim}, we simulated 500 datasets according to the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw $ \log(R0 - 1),\ 1/\mu,\ \logit(\rho),\ \log(\phi) $ from the priors given in Table \ref{tab:lna_coverage_sim}.
	\item Simulate an outbreak, $ \bN|\btheta $, under SIR dynamics from the MJP via Gillespie's direct algorithm \cite{gillespie1976general}. If there were fewer than 15 cases, simulate another outbreak. 
	\item Simulate the observed incidence, $ \bY|\bN,\btheta $, as a negative binomial sample of the true incidence in each epoch, i.e., $ Y_\ell\sim\mr{Neg.Binomial(\rho(N_{SI}(t_\ell) - N_{SI}(t_{\ell-1})), \phi)} $. If the outbreak died off before epoch 15, the dataset was truncated at 15 observations (i.e., the dataset consisted of a series of case counts accrued during the outbreak along with a series of trailing zeros accrued after the outbreak died off). If the outbreak lasted longer than 50 epochs, the dataset was truncated at 50 observations
\end{enumerate}
