\section{Tuning the Initial Elliptical Slice Sampling Bracket Width}
\label{sec:lna_init_bracket_width}

When fitting SEMs with complex dynamics, e.g., when there are many strata or when the dynamics are time varying, we will be able improve the computational efficiency of our MCMC by initialing the ElliptSS bracket width at $ \omega < 2\pi $. This choice is motivated by the observation that when the model dynamics are complex, the ElliptSS bracket will typically need to be shrunk many times before the sampler reaches a range of acceptable angles in the proposal. Each time we propose a new angle in the ElliptSS algorithm we must solve the LNA ODEs in order to compute the observed data likelihood. Thus, if we can reduce the number of ElliptSS steps, we will be able to shorten the time required to complete our MCMC runs. 

In models where it is advantageous to shring the initial bracket width, we will typically set the initial bracket width to a constant times the standard deviation of the accepted angles in a tuning phase. Since we do not step out the ElliptSS bracket, the initial width should not be so small as to induce additional autocorrelation in the latent process, and should also not be so wide that the bracket is contracted needlessly. We have found a bracket width of $ \omega = 2\sqrt{2\log(10)}\sigma $, corresponding to the full width at one tenth maximum for a Gaussian with standard deviation $ \sigma $, to work well in practice. Figure \ref{fig:esstuning} presents histograms of the number of contractions per ElliptSS update and the accepted angles before and after contracting the initial ElliptSS bracket width for the joint Ebola model of Section \ref{sec:lna_ebola}. In this instance, we were able to substantially reduce the number of contractions, and hence likelihood evaluations, per ElliptSS update while leaving the distribution of accepted angles essentially unchanged. We like to call this a "free lunch".

	\caption[Distributions of numbers of contractions and accepted for elliptical slice sampling.]{Distributions of the numbers of contractions per ElliptSS update and the accepted angles for an MCMC chain for the joint Ebola model of Section \ref{sec:lna_ebola} . An initial bracket width of $ 2\pi $ was used for the first 5,000 iterations (top row), after which the initial bracket width was set to $ 2\sqrt{2\log(10)}\sigma_{ElliptSS} $, where $ \sigma_{ElliptSS} $ was the standard deviation of the accepted angles from the initial run (bottom row).} 
	\label{fig:esstuning}
\end{figure}

We mentioned in Section \ref{subsubsec:noncentered_parameterization} that our ElliptSS algorithm was modified slightly from that presented in \cite{murray2010} in order to facilitate tuning of the initial ElliptSS bracket width. In both cases, the distribution of proposed states, $ \bZ_{prop} $, is centered at the current state $ \bZ_{cur} $. However, the distribution of angles of accepted states using our algorithm will be centered around 0, whereas the distribution of angles for accepted proposals using the algorithm in \cite{murray2010} will be bimodal with peaks at 0 and $ 2\pi $. The algorithms are nevertheless equivalent due to the rotational symmetry of the proposals (a proposal made using an angle $ \phi $ is equivalent to a proposal using $ \phi+2\pi $). It is more natural to compute the standard deviation of the accepted angles if the distribution of angles is symmetric about zero than if it is bimodal (and would thus require a rotation).

\section{Inference for Initial Compartment Volumes}
\label{sec:lna_init_volumes}

When the initial compartment volumes are included as initial parameters in the model instead of being treated as fixed, we will model them as arising from the following truncated multivariate normal distribution: \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lna_initdist_prior}
\bX_0 \sim TMVN_{\mcS_X^R}(N\bp,N(\bP - \bp\bp^T)),
\end{equation} 
where $ \bp $ is a vector of subject--level initial state probabilities, $ \bP = \diag(\bp) $, $ N $ is the population size, and the subscript $ \mcS_X^R $ specifies the state space of $ \bX $ (so that the compartment volumes add up to $ N $ and each compartment volume is non--negative and less than the total population size at time $ t_0 $). Thus, the initial distribution is specified as the truncated normal approximation of a multinomial distribution with size $ N $ and probability vector $ \bp $. In models with multiple strata, we will similarly model the initial compartment volumes as having independent truncated multivariate normal distributions that are each approximations of multinomial distributions over initial compartment counts within each stratum. Notation and details are completely analogous to the single stratum case, and are therefore omitted for the sake of clarity.

Let $ \bV = N(\bP - \bp\bp^T) $, and $ \bV^{1/2} $ be the matrix square root of $ \bV $, which we will compute using the singular value decomposition $ \bV = \bU\bD\bU^T \implies \bV^{1/2} = \bU\bD^{1/2}$. Let $ \bZ^X $ denote the LNA draws as before, and let $ \bZ^{X_0}\sim\mr{MVN}(\bs{0},\mb{I}) $ denote the vector of draws that will be mapped to $ \bX_0 $. We will update the initial compartment volumes jointly with the LNA draws using elliptical slice sampling.

\section{Choice of Estimation Scale and Implications for Mixing and Convergence}
\label{sec:est_scale_discussion}

How we parameterize the MCMC estimation scale is critically important to its computational performance. If we can identify transformations of the model parameters that minimize strong correlations and non--linear relationships on the estimation scale, we will be able to substantially improve MCMC mixing. In our context, it will often be relatively straightforward to identify such transformations (or at least intermediate transformations that can be used in combination). As a general approach, we will try to identify transformations that reflect the ways in which model parameters jointly act on the model dynamics, and then a second set of transformations that remove any boundary conditions. 
\begin{table}[htbp]

		$ \beta $ & Per--contact rate of infection within the population & $[0,\infty) $\\
		$ \omega $ & Rate of transition from $ E\rightarrow I $ & $[ 0,\infty) $\\

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As an example, consider the single country SEIR model fit to the incidence data from Sierra Leone in Section \ref{sec:lna_ebola}. This model includes parameters for the external force of infection and the effective population size, which add complexity to the usual formulation of the SEIR dynamics as being entirely driven by endogenous contacts within a closed homogeneously mixing population. The effective population size is roughly the size of the initially susceptible population. The model parameters on their natural scales are provided in Table \ref{tab:seir_params_nat}. Each of the model parameters has a clear marginal interpretation, but upon examining the pairwise scatterplots of the posterior (Figure \ref{fig:slpairs1}) it becomes obvious that the parameters interact in highly non--linear ways. We would encounter a variety of pathological computational problems if we were to naively parameterize the MCMC estimation scale without considering the ways in which the parameters interact to affect the dynamics. For example, it would be extremely difficult for any sampler that does not account for the curvature in the posterior, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), to explore the parameter space. (An aside: we experimented with implementing the LNA in \texttt{Stan} and using HMC to sample the posterior, but repeatedly integrating the LNA ODEs along with their augmented sensitivity equations was prohibitively slow for even simple models).

	\label{fig:slpairs1}
\end{figure}

We can mitigate the problems caused by non--linear relationships and strong correlations among parameters by parameterizing the estimation scale in terms of how the parameters jointly affect the model dynamics and then removing the boundary conditions. Table \ref{tab:seir_params_est2} provides a list of parameters on their estimation scale that are reflective of an initial first pass at how we would expect the parameters to interact. For example, the parameters governing the rates of infectious contact, $ \alpha$ and $\beta $, combine with the effective population size and the infectious period duration to produce the basic reproductive numbers with respect to initially infected individuals outside and inside the population. Still, we can see that there are some residual non--linear relationships between the log effective population size, the logit case detection probability, and the effective reproductive number.

\end{figure}

A heuristic argument for an estimation scale that further simplifies the posterior geometry proceeds by analogy with the analogous deterministic ODE model. In particular, we will consider how the functions of model parameters in Table \ref{tab:seir_params_est2} act on the model dynamics through the final size relation, and how they are informed by the data. The final size relation for the ODE model \cite{miller2012note} relates the fraction of the population that eventually becomes infected $ \pi $, with the basic reproductive number:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:final_size_relation}
\pi = 1 - \e^{-R0\pi}.
\end{equation}
As $ R0 $ increases, a larger fraction of the population becomes infected. As the effective population size, $ N_{eff}$, increases, so too does the absolute outbreak size, $ \pi \times N_{eff} $. The expected observed outbreak size is the absolute outbreak size multiplied by the mean case detection probability, $ \pi \times \rho \times N_{eff} $, which should be concordant with the total number of observed cases. We can interpret the product, $ \rho \times N_{eff} $, as a measure of the case detection rate. This is discussed further in the next section. Taken together, the combination of parameters that we would expect to jointly act on the model, \textit{a posteriori}, is the effective reproduction number offset by the case detection rate, $ R0\times\rho \times N_{eff} $, which will enter our estimation scale as $ \log(R0\times\rho\times N_{eff}) $. The other modification of the estimation scale in Table \ref{tab:seir_params_est2} replaces the log latent period with the log ratio of infectious to latent period durations. The new estimation scale is given in Table \ref{tab:seir_params_est3}. On this estimation scale, the posterior for Sierra Leone is much better behaved, with weaker pairwise correlations and little in the way of non--linear relationships between the model parameters.

\section{Identifiability when Estimating the Effective Population Size}
\label{sec:effpop_identifiability}
When the scale of an outbreak is small relative to the population size, it may be unreasonable to assume that the entire population mixes homogeneously and participates in propagating the epidemic. A more reasonable, though arguably still dubious, abstraction of the outbreak setting involves splitting the population into two (or more) sub--populations, one that participates in the outbreak and another that is separated from the outbreak. For example, in the case of the SIR model, we might have two susceptible compartments, $ S^R $ and $ S^E $, where $ S^R $ is a susceptible subpopulation that is effectively removed since they experience no infectious contact, and $ S^E $ is a susceptible population that may become exposed. In this model, the \textit{effective population size} is $ N_{eff} = S^E + I + R $. The model is otherwise constructed in the same way as the SIR model, except with $ S^E $ replacing $ S $. 

Absent prior information, the effective population size and the mean case detection probability are not separately identifiable parameters. Rather, we can only hope to estimate the mean case reporting rate, $ \rho\times N_{eff} $. To see why this is so, consider that the two parameters enter into the complete data likelihood, (\ref{eqn:lna_ncp}), through the priors and through the product of emission probabilities in the observed data likelihood. These emission probabilities could be, for example, negative binomial distributions as in (\ref{eqn:incidence_emitprob}). The key point to note is that the mean of the emission distribution is of the form, $ \rho\Delta N_{SI}(t_\ell) $. Recalling that the LNA (and the MJP on which it is based) is a density dependent process \cite{komorowski2009,wilkinson2011stochastic} scaled by the size of the system, here $ N_{eff} $, we should actually understand the mean observed incidence to be the mean case detection probability multiplied by a change in concentrations and the effective population size, $ \rho\left (N^\prime_{S^EI}(t_{\ell}) - N^\prime_{S^EI}(t_{\ell-1})\right )N_{eff} $, where $ \bN^\prime = \bN/N_{eff} $ is the equivalent representation of the LNA in terms of compartment concentrations. Absent constraints on $ \rho $ or $ N_{eff} $, either by artificially fixing one or via their priors, the parameters are unidentifiable. 

We can check that $ \rho\times N_{eff} $ and the parameters governing the outbreak dynamics are identifiable via a simple simulation. We drew 500 sets of parameters from the priors given in Table \ref{tab:effpop_coverage_settings}, and simulated an outbreak and a dataset for each set of parameters. The models were fit via the LNA under the same priors from which the parameters were drawn. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:effpop_coverage_results}. The nominal coverage rates for all model parameters is approximately correct. However,the relative widths of the posterior credible intervals for the case detection rate are substantially narrower than the relative widths of the credible intervals for $ \rho $ and $ N_{eff} $. This suggests that the data are informative about $ \rho\times N_{eff} $. Note that the priors are not completely flat, so we still expect, and observe, some shrinkage for $ \rho $ and $ N_{eff} $, individually.

We conclude by pointing out the important, and perhaps obvious, implication of these results that estimates of the latent epidemic process is only weakly identifiable in models where the effective population size is unknown. We are rescued, somewhat, by the

\section{Simulation Details and Additional Results for Section \ref{subsec:lna_coverage}}
\label{sec:lna_coverage_supplement}

\subsection{Simulation Setup and MCMC Details}
\label{subsec:lna_coverage_setup_details}

In this simulation, repeated for each of the three different regimes of population size and initial conditions given in Table \ref{tab:lna_coverage_sim}, we simulated 500 datasets according to the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw $ \log(R0 - 1),\ 1/\mu,\ \logit(\rho),\ \log(\phi) $ from the priors given in Table \ref{tab:lna_coverage_sim}.
	\item Simulate an outbreak, $ \bN|\btheta $, under SIR dynamics from the MJP via Gillespie's direct algorithm \cite{gillespie1976general}. If there were fewer than 15 cases, simulate another outbreak. 
	\item Simulate the observed incidence, $ \bY|\bN,\btheta $, as a negative binomial sample of the true incidence in each epoch, i.e., $ Y_\ell\sim\mr{Neg.Binomial(\rho(N_{SI}(t_\ell) - N_{SI}(t_{\ell-1})), \phi)} $. If the outbreak died off before epoch 15, the dataset was truncated at 15 observations (i.e., the dataset consisted of a series of case counts accrued during the outbreak along with a series of trailing zeros accrued after the outbreak died off). If the outbreak lasted longer than 50 epochs, the dataset was truncated at 50 observations
\end{enumerate}

We proceed to fit SIR models using the LNA, ODE, and MMTL approximations. Priors for model parameters were assigned as in Table \ref{tab:lna_coverage_sim}. Five MCMC chains per model were initialized at random values near the true parameters and run for 35,000 iterations per chain. The first 10,000 iterations used to warm up each chain and adaptively estimate the empirical covariance matrix to be used in the multivariate Gaussian random walk Metropolis--Hastings proposals for parameters. The empirical covariance matrix was initialized as 0.01 times an identity matrix. After the warm--up period, the empirical covariance matrix was frozen and the final 25,000 iterations from each chain were combined to form the final MCMC sample. Convergence was assessed using potential scale reduction factors (PSRFs) \cite{brooks1998general}, computed via the \texttt{coda} R package \cite{codapackage}. PSRFs were less than 1.05 in all cases.

For models fit via the LNA and ODE approximations, the covariance matrix was adapted as in algorithm 4 of \cite{andrieu2008tutorial}. The gain factor sequence was $\gamma_n = 0.25(1 + 0.05n)^{-0.50001}$, and a small nugget variance, equal to 0.00001 times an identity matrix, was added during the adaptation phase. The target acceptance rate used in the adaptation was 0.234. The models were implemented using the \text{stemr} R package \cite{stemr}.

Inference via the MMTL approximation within PMMH were fit using the \texttt{pomp} R package \cite{pompjss}. We used 500 particles in the PMMH algorithm. This choice was made to mitigate issues of particle degeneracy that occurred with fewer particles for some datasets. The time step for MMTL was set to 1/7, which, for example, corresponds to $ \tau $--leaping over one day increments given weekly incidence data. The MCMC was initialized in the same way as LNA and ODE models, but the empirical covariance matrix was adapted according to a different cooling schedule. The gain factor sequence provided by the package is of the form $ \gamma_n = n^\alpha $, where the cooling term, $ \alpha $, was set to 0.999. For some of the datasets, the PMMH algorithm degenerated during the adaptive phase of the MCMC. If this was the case, the MCMC was restarted at a different set of random initial conditions. The posterior sample consisted of the combined samples from all five MCMC chains after discarding the initial samples from the adaptation phase.

\section{Supplementary Coverage Simulations with Fixed Parameters}
\label{sec:lna_fixedpar_coverage}

\subsection{Simulation Setup}
\label{subsec:lna_fixedpar_setup}

The simulations presented in this section supplement the results of Section \ref{subsec:lna_coverage} in assessing the statistical and computation performance of the LNA approximation vis--a--vis the ODE and MMTL approximations. In contrast to the previous coverage simulation, here we will fix the model parameters to one of four regimes, presented in Table \ref{tab:lna_supplementary_coverage_sim}, that are characterized by either fast or moderate outbreak dynamics, and high or low detection probability. In each setting, we simulated 500 outbreaks from a MJP with SIR dynamics in a population of 50,000 individuals, five of whom were initially infected and the rest of whom were susceptible. The observed incidence in each epoch was a negative binomial sample of the true incidence. Outbreaks for which the number of observed cases was less than 25 were re--simulated. MCMC chains were tuned and SIR models were fit via the LNA, ODE, and MMTL approximations as described in Section \ref{subsec:lna_coverage_setup_details}. The initial comparment volumes were fixed at the true values. The models were fit using diffuse priors, also presented in Table \ref{tab:lna_supplementary_coverage_sim}. We caution that the priors used in this exercise are perhaps unreasonably diffuse, particularly in the context of epidemic modeling where prior information is often available, and that we expect credible intervals will be overly wide as a result (we would still expect nominal coverage to be incorrect, even under tighter priors, since the datasets were simulated under fixed parameter regimes).

\newpage

\subsection{Fixed Parameter Coverage Results}
\label{subsec:lna_fixedpar_sim_results}

Coverage for credible intervals of ODE models tended to fall below nominal levels in spite of the bias towards wide intervals due to the diffusivity of the priors. This was particularly the case in parameter regimes 1 and 3, where the basic reproductive number was lower (and hence the simulated outbreak trajectories further from their thermodynamic limits). In these parameter regimes, coverage was particularly poor due as estimates of the outbreak dynamics tended to be farther from their true values and credible intervals were too tight and did not properly account for uncertainty about the parameter estimates, particularly those governing the measurement process. Coverage levels for models fit via the LNA and MMTL approximations exceeded their nominal levels as expected. 

ODE models remained the most computationally performant. However, in this exercise, the LNA substantially outperformed the MMTL approximation within PMMH in terms of ESS and ESS per CPU time. We believe this is largely attributable to the diffusivity of the priors, which not only fail to regularize the posterior, but likely pull it towards unreasonable regions of the parameter space. As a general comment, we would strongly caution practitioners against adopting such priors more broadly. While it may seem appealing to adopt such diffuse priors in pursuit of being "agnostic" to the underlying outbreak dynamics, one of the very good reasons for working within the Bayesian paradigm in this context is that we have quite a bit of prior information regarding the outbreak dynamics and reasonable ranges for the case detection probability. For example, we often have historic examples of outbreaks in similar settings that we can look to in specifying priors about the basic reproductive number.

\section{Synthetic Ebola Outbreak --- Simulation Settings and Additional Results}
\label{sec:ebola_synth_supp}

\subsection{Simulation Details}
\label{subsec:ebola_synth_setup}

We simulated an outbreak for a stratified SEIR model, diagrammed in Figure \ref{fig:stratified_seir_full_diag}, for the spread of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, via Gillespie's direct algorithm \cite{gillespie1976general}. Transmission was driven by contact with infected individuals within the country, and migration of infected individuals from other countries. The countries differed in their transmission dynamics, case detection probabilities, and effective population sizes. In addition, the times at which transmission commenced in each country were staggered. The outbreak began in Guinea with transmission beggining in Liberia at the start of week 10, and in Sierra Leone at the start of week 19. The rates of between country transmission, along with the other rates of state transition, for Liberia and Sierra Leone were set to zero prior to those times. The constants and parameters used in simulating the outbreak and data are given in Tables \ref{tab:ebola_synth_consts} and \ref{tab:ebola_synth_consts}. The priors used in fitting the models are given in Tables \ref{tab:ebola_synth_pars} and \ref{tab:ebola_synth_initdist_priors}.

Dashed boxes denote countries, nodes in circles denote the model compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), recovered (R). Compartments  are subscripted with country indicators. Solid lines with arrows indicate stochastic transitions between model compartments, which occur continuously in time. Rates at which individuals transition between compartments are denoted by $ \lambda $ and are subscripted by compartments and superscripted by countries, e.g., $ \lambda_{SE}^L $ is the rate at which susceptible individuals become exposed in Liberia, $ \lambda_I^{SG} $ is the rate at which an infected individual in Sierra Leone migrates to Guinea. The rate at which susceptible individuals in Guinea become infected is time varying with one changepoint at 33 weeks.}

The model is diagrammed in Figure \ref{fig:stratified_seir_full_diag}. Subscripts in the rates denote model compartments, superscripts denote countries. Subscripts for parameters denote countries. The rate at which susceptibles in Guine become infected is time varying with one changepoint at 33 weeks. Transmission in Liberia and Sierra Leone prior to weeks 10 and 19 is expressed in the initial compartment volumes at those times. Thus, all respective transition rates are set to zero prior to the times when transmission commenced in those countries.}

\subsection{MCMC Details}
\label{subsec:ebola_synth_mcmc}
We fit two models to the simulated data, the true model where migration was modeled explicitly and the approximated model, described in Section \ref{subsec:ebola_synth}, where cross--border transmission was incorporated into the rate of infection via virtual migration. The model fitting procedure and priors were the same for both models. We ran five chains for each model, initialized at random parameter values, for 200,000 iterations per chain. The model parameters, not including the initial compartment volumes, were jointly updated via MVNSS (see Section \ref{subsubsec:mvn_slice_sampling}). The empirical covariance for the MVNSS algorithm was update over the first 100,000 iterations using the gain factor sequence, $\gamma_n = 0.5(1 + 0.01n)^{-0.9}$. The contribution of isotropic Gaussian noise to the proposal was initialized at 0.001 and reduced throughout the adaptation phase according to the sequence $ \iota_n = 0.001(1 + 0.01n)^{-0.99} $. The covariance matrix was blocked by country with covariances for parameters belonging to different countries set to zero. Thus, country specific parameters were proposed jointly but were independent in the proposal. Migration parameters were blocked with parameters corresponding to the destination country. The initial compartment volumes were updated jointly with the LNA paths in an EllipSS step. The MCMC alternated between three ElliptSS and two MVNSS updates per MCMC iteration. The ElliptSS bracket width was reset after the first 5,000 MCMC iterations to $ \omega = 2\sqrt{2\log(10)}\sigma_{ElliptSS}$, where $ \sigma_{ElliptSS} $ was the standard deviation of the accepted angles over the initial iterations. The MCMC estimation scales for each country were parameterized as in Table \ref{tab:seir_params_est3} with the one addition being the log ratio of effective reproductive numbers, subtract one, for Guinea, $ \log\left ((R_{eff,G}^{(2)}-1)/(R_{eff,G}^{(1)}-1)\right ) $. Convergence was assessed using potential scale reduction factors (PSRFs) \cite{brooks1998general}, computed via the \texttt{coda} R package \cite{codapackage}. PSRFs were less than 1.05 in all cases.
