\chapter{Models with Time--Varying Dynamics for Pandemic A(H1N1) Influenza in Finland}
\label{chap:lna_extensions}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:lna_extensions_overview}
To this point, we have largely worked with stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) where the transmission dynamics of an outbreak are time--homogeneous. This is possibly only mildly unreasonable for short outbreaks in closed, relatively ``well--mixed" populations, and is often an attractive modeling choice as SEMs with static dynamics are easier to interpret and fit. Incidence data typically arise in settings where the outbreak milieu can evolve due to environmental changes, heterogeneity in the contact structures of various subpopulations as they are exposed, or behavioral responses as people become aware of an outbreak (or complacent about the extent to which it is under control). Furthermore, we are often interested in understanding the effects of interventions that are time--varying in their implementation or action, such as vaccination campaigns, on the transmission dynamics of an outbreak. Thus, it is important, if not necessary, that we allow the time--varying aspects of an outbreak to be flexibly expressed in the model.

In this chapter, we will use SEMs with time--varying force of infection (FOI) to model the spread of pandemic A(H1N1) influenza in Finland using surveillance data. Our goals will be to quantify the transmission dynamics of the outbreak, to estimate the true incidence, and to understand what effect a national vaccination campaign had in mitigating the outbreak severity. We will fit several models of varying complexity using the linear noise approximation (LNA) framework developed in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems}.

\subsection{Pandemic A(H1N1) Influenza in Finland}
\label{subsec:flu_description}

The emergence of a pandemic influenza A strain, A(H1N1)pdm09, in the spring of 2009 led to widespread concern that it would lead to high mortality and excessive stress on public health systems around the world. The strain, commonly referred to as ``swine flu", was a triple reassortment of human, avian, and swine viruses, and was of particular concern because of its similarity with the 1918 pandemic strain that infected up to a third of the world's population and led to an estimated 50 million deaths \cite{cdc1918pandemic}. While the burden imposed by the 2009 pandemic was ultimately comparable to that of seasonal influenza \cite{iuliano2018estimates}, it nevertheless resulted in an estimated 110,000--400,000 respiratory deaths and 50,000--180,000 cardivascular deaths \cite{dawood2012estimated}. The age--standardized cumulative incidence was estimated from serological samples in 19 countries to be between 20\%--27\% \cite{van2013estimating}, with attack rates and transmission dynamics varying greatly by age, and being consistently more severe in children and adolescents \cite{opatowski2011transmission,steens2011age,van2013estimating,yang2015inference}. 

We will analyze surveillance data, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:finland_fludat}, from the first and second waves of the epidemic in Finland. The dataset, previously analyzed in \cite{shubin2016revealing} and \cite{shubin2014estimating}, consists of weekly counts of laboratory--confirmed A(H1N1) cases, aggregated into sixteen age strata, that were culled from a national surveillance system \cite{lyytikainen2011surveillance}. For computational considerations, we will further aggregate the data into two age groups, individuals ages 0--19 those of ages 20+, chosen on basis of differences in mixing patterns, susceptibility, vaccination priority, and observed attack rates \cite{kelly2011age,opatowski2011transmission,steens2011age}. All cases in our dataset were of mild severity, i.e., cases that did not require hospitalization. Following \cite{shubin2016revealing,shubin2014estimating}, we treat all A(H1N1) cases as A(H1N1)pdm09 as nearly all A(H1N1) cases were of the pandemic strain. It is critical to note that the data are not marked by vaccination status.

An important aspect of the pandemic response in Finland was the execution of a concerted vaccination campaign with the adjuvented monovalent vaccine Pandemrix. Each resident was offered one vaccine dose, free of charge, starting in October, 2009. Vaccination priority was given to health care workers, vulnerable individuals, and young people under the age of 20 \cite{syrjanen2014effectiveness}.  Coverage levels and the timing of vaccination administration varied by age, see Figure \ref{fig:finland_fludat}, with highest coverage among children under the age of 15 ($ \approx $70\%) and the lowest among young adults between the ages of 20--29 ($ \approx $30\%). In other settings, vaccine efficacy was also found to be higher in children than adults \cite{lansbury2017effectiveness}. Data was not available on vaccine coverage for a trivalent vaccine administered during the 2010--2011 season.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

In this work, we will be primarily interested in three lines of inquiry. First, we will quantify the transmission dynamics and effectiveness of disease surveillance during the first and second seasons. The most important aspect of this involves estimating time--varying reproduction numbers that are interpretable as thresholds for sustained transmission. Second, we will estimate age--specific attack rates and incidence curves, accounting for underreporting, so that we may better understand the true burden of the pandemic. Finally, we will attempt to estimate a measure of vaccine efficacy for susceptibility, and to learn what effect, if any, the vaccination campaign had in mitigating the severity of the outbreak.

\subsection{The Importance of Allowing for Time--Varying Dynamics}
\label{subsec:tparam_motivation}

A critical aspect of modeling outbreaks over multiple seasons is that we must account for changes in rates of infectious contacts both within, and between, seasons. The decline in transmission at the end of the first season is attributable, in some combination, to stochastic extinction, a decline in the rate of infectious contact, and a reduction in the effective number of susceptible individuals via immunity acquired from natural exposure or vaccination. It is difficult to explain the emergence of the second season without allowing for stochastic reemergence, changes in the FOI, and waning immunity. Put another way, it is highly unlikely an outbreak that died off in a population protected by herd immunity would reemerge absent changes in FOI or susceptibility of the population. 

Before delving into details of how we intend to accomodate time--inhomogeneity in the FOI, we briefly highlight why we should allow for time--inhomogeneity in the FOI. To make the point, we compare results for two SIRS models fit to incidence counts from an outbreak with time--inhomogeneous dynamics. The data were simulated from an SIRS model where the rate of infectious contact varied sinusoidally over the course of two waves (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots}). While both models allowed for loss of immunity, the per--contact infectious rate was held constant in one model, and in the other was allowed to vary in time, with changes penalized via a first order Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) shrinkage prior (details presented in \ref{sec:flu_tparam_models} and \ref{sec:tparam_motiv_details}). 

Although both models are misspecified vis--a--vis the  data generating model, the model with time--varying FOI was clearly better able to capture the dynamics of the outbreak (Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots}). Estimates of basic and effective reproduction numbers captured the true basic and effective reproduction numbers throughout both seasons. The model with time--varying FOI is also able to recover the true incidence. In contrast, the model with constant FOI fails to accurately estimate the basic and effective reproduction numbers between seasons and during the second wave. It also completely fails to capture the incidence during the second wave. Unlike the model with time--varying FOI, the model with constant FOI also fails to recover the hyperparameters governing the outbreak dynamics and sampling process. In particular the mean duration of immunity and case detection rate are important parameters that are poorly estimated (Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_param_plots}). Finally, the posterior predictive distributions for the model with time--varying FOI are more accurate, and more precise, than posterior predictive distributions for the model with constant FOI (Figures \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots} and \ref{fig:sinfoi_ppi_comp}).

\section{Modeling the Spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Finland}
\label{sec:flu_tparam_models}

\subsection{Data and Vaccination}
\label{subsec:flu_datavacc}

We will model the time series of weekly incidence counts in youths (Y), ages 0--19, and adults (A), ages 20+, over a one year period beginning in epiweek 15, 2009, one month prior to the first observed case in the first season, and a 37 week period beginning in epiweek 37, 2010, one month prior to the first observed case in the second season. Data from the inter--season period, epiweeks 15--36, 2010, over which a total of three cases were observed, were not considered to be informative about the transmission dynamics during the outbreak seasons and were aggregated for computational reasons. Thus, the cases accrued over the inter--season period were indexed at epiweek 36, 2010. We denote the data as, $$ \bY = \left (\left (Y_{Y,1},Y_{A,1}\right ),\dots,\left (Y_{Y,52},Y_{A,52}\right ),\left (Y^\prime_{Y,75},Y^\prime_{A,75}\right ),\dots,\left (Y_{Y,113},Y_{A,113}\right )\right ), $$ with time zero corresponding to epiweek 15, 2009. The observed incidence in age--stratum $ j $ at week $ \ell $ is modeled as a negative binomial sample of the true incidence \begin{equation}
\label{flu_emit_prob}
Y_{j,\ell} ~ \mr{Neg.Binom}\left (\mu = \rho_j(\Delta N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) + \Delta N_{SI}^{(v)}(t_\ell)), \sigma^2 = \mu + \mu^2 / \phi_j\right ),
\end{equation}
where $ \rho_j $ is the age--specific mean case detection rate, $ \phi_j $ is an age--specific overdispersion parameter, and $ \Delta $ is a differencing operator for the cumulative incidence in a age--vaccination stratum, e.g., $ \Delta N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) = N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) - N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_{\ell-1}) $ is change in cumulative incidence between times $ t_{\ell-1} $ and $ t_\ell $.

\subsection{Model Structure}
\label{subsec:flu_modstructure}

We will use the LNA framework developed in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems} to fit an age--vaccination stratified susceptible--infected--recovered--susceptible (SIRS) model in which individuals transition stochastically, and continuously in time, between disease states. They become infectious immediately upon becoming infected, and acquire temporary, though potentially long lasting, protection upon recovery. Individuals who lose immunity are assumed to become fully susceptible. For simplicity, we assume a closed population and ignore demographic changes or mortality since the age groupings are considerably coarser than the time period under consideration. All individuals were assumed to be susceptible and unvaccinated at the start of the modeling period. The model is diagrammed in Figure \ref{fig:flu_sirs_diag}, and Table \ref{tab:flu_notation} lists the model parameters and their interpretations.

By taking the sojourn time in each disease state to be exponentially distributed, and leveraging the exchangeability of individuals within the model, we represent the time--evolution of the epidemic as a Markov jump process (MJP), $$ \bX^c = \lbrace S_{Y}^{(u)}, I_{Y}^{(u)}, R_{Y}^{(u)},
S_{Y}^{(v)}, I_{Y}^{(v)}, R_{Y}^{(v)}, S_{A}^{(u)}, I_{A}^{(u)}, R_{A}^{(u)},
S_{A}^{(v)}, I_{A}^{(v)}, R_{A}^{(v)} \rbrace, $$ on the state space of compartment counts, $ \mcS_X^c$, with corresponding cumulative incidence process $ \bN^c $ on the state space of cumulative incidence counts $ \mcS_N^c $.

The contact rate between individuals in age stratum $ j $ and age stratum $ k $, denoted $ C_{jk} $, was based on estimated mean contact rates, appropriately standardized (see Section \ref{sec:flu_contact_rates}), from the Finnish arm of the POLYMOD survey \cite{mossong2008social,polymod} and accessed via the \texttt{socialmixr R} package \cite{funk2018socialmixr}. Sixty percent of contacts in the 0--19 age group were from other individuals age 0--19, while eighty--five percent of the contacts in the 20+ age group were from other adults.  The rates, $ \blambda = (\blambda_{Y},\blambda_{A}) $, at which individuals in age--stratum $ j \in {Y,\ A} $ transition between disease states are
\begin{equation}\small
\label{eqn:flu_sirs_rates}
\blambda_{j} = \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{ll}

\lambda_{SI,j}^{(v)} = \nu_{j}\left [\alpha_{j}(t) + \beta_{j}(t)\left (C_{jk}\left (I_{j}^{(u)} + I_{j}^{(v)}\right ) + (1-C_{jk})\left (I_{k}^{(u)} + I_{k}^{(v)}\right )\right )\right ]S_{j}^{v}\\

\lambda_{RS,j}^{(u)} = \omega R_{j}^{(u)} \\
\lambda_{RS,j}^{(v)} = \omega R_{j}^{(v)}
\end{array}
\right .
\end{equation}

At weekly intervals, we deterministically force individuals from unvaccinated model compartments to the corresponding vaccinated compartments. Following \cite{shubin2016revealing}, we assume that vaccine doses were distributed independently and in proportionally to the number of individuals in each unvaccinated compartment of the corresponding age stratum. In \cite{shubin2016revealing}, it was assumed that vaccination was fully protective with 80\% probability two weeks after administration. Here, we will assume that the vaccine is partially protective in that it reduces the rate at which vaccinated individuals become infected. We do not model vaccine efficacy for infectiousness or recovery due to the limited extent of the data. To account for the time required to elicit an immune response, we apply the deterministic forcing at the beginning of week after the time when each dose count was indexed. Thus, suppose that at the end of week $ \ell $ we have $ \bX_j^{(u)}(t_\ell) = \left (S_j^{(u)}(t_\ell), I_j^{(u)}(t_\ell), R_j^{(u)}(t_\ell)\right ) $ unvaccinated susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in age stratum $ j $ and $ \bX_j^{(v)}(t_\ell) = \left (S_j^{(v)}(t_\ell), I_j^{(v)}(t_\ell), R_j^{(v)}(t_\ell)\right ) $ vaccinated individuals, and that $ V_j(t_\ell) $ vaccine doses were recorded for stratum $ j $ in that week. We apply the vaccine forcing to the initial state for the following week: 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:vacc_forcing}
\begin{split}
	\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell^+) &= \bX_j^{(u)}(t_\ell) - V_j(t_\ell)\frac{\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}{\sum\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}, \\
	\bX_{j}^{(v)}(t_\ell^+) &= \bX_j^{(v)}(t_\ell) + V_j(t_\ell)\frac{\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}{\sum\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Thus, the vaccination forcing affects the initial condition for the period $ (t_\ell,t_{\ell+1}] $, not the state at time $ t_\ell $. 

The diffusion approximation for the MJP is a real--valued process, $ \bX $, on the analogous state space of compartment volumes, $ \mcS_X^R $, and with corresponding cumulative incidence process, $ \bN $, with state space $ \mcS_N^R $. Note that the boundary conditions on the state spaces of $ \bX^c $ and $ \bN^c $, and similarly of $ \bX $ and $ \bN $, ensure positivity of compartment counts and monotonicity of cumulative incidence paths, and that the compartment counts each age--vaccination stratum sum to the number of individuals in that stratum, e.g., $ S_{Y}^{(u)}(t) + I_{Y}^{(u)}(t) + R_{Y}^{(u)}(t) = N_{Y}^{(u)}(t) $. As in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems}, we will use the non--centered parameterization of the restarting LNA of the log--transformed SDE to approximate the time--evolution of $ \bX^c $ and $ \bN^c $. Algorithm \ref{alg:elliptss_lna_gmrf} for sampling LNA draws using elliptical slice sampling (ElliptSS) is given in Section \ref{sec:lna_ess_gmrf}.

\subsubsection{Reproduction numbers}
\label{subsubsec:stratmod_repnumbs}
The basic reproduction number, $ R_0 $, (and its variants) describes the propensity of an outbreak to spread through a population \cite{heffernan2005perspectives,van2008further}. It is loosely interpreted as the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. An outbreak will fail to sustain itself (almost surely when it evolves deterministically, but in reality with high probability due to the inherently stochastic nature of epidemics) when $ R_0 < 1 $. For this reason, epidemiologists often quantify the effectiveness of a control measure by estimating the extent to which it reduces $ R_0 $, hopefully below 1. We can interpret the basic reproduction number as an intrinsic reproduction number in cases, such as ours, when there is an exogenous contribution to force of infection \cite{blackwood2018introduction}. From a modeling perspective, is helpful to understand not only how $ R_0 $ affects the transmission dynamics, but also how various aspects of the model interact to affect $ R_0 $. This is important for parameterizing the model and assimilating prior information about how different aspects of the model \textit{jointly} influence the outbreak dynamics.

The basic reproduction number of a structured SEM may be obtained by computing spectral radius of the next generation matrix (NGM) for the linearized system of ODEs specifying the flow in and out of states at infection (see \cite{heffernan2005perspectives,van2008further,van2017reproduction} for details). The $ i,j $ element of the NGM gives the expected number of secondary infections in age stratum $ i $ given an index infection in stratum $ j $. Noting that vaccinated and unvaccinated invididuals in this model are equally transmissive and have the same mean infectious period durations, we obtain the age--structured next generation matrix
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:sirs_ngm_full}
\bK &= 
	\left (
	\begin{array}{cc}
	K_{YY} & K_{YA} \\
	K_{AY} & K_{AA}
	\end{array}
	\right ) \nonumber\\
	&=\left (
	\begin{array}{cc}
	\frac{C_{YY}\beta_Y\left (N_Y^{(u)} + \nu_YN_Y^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_Y} & \frac{C_{YA}\beta_Y\left (N_Y^{(u)} + \nu_YN_Y^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_A} \\[2ex]
	\frac{C_{AY}\beta_A\left (N_A^{(u)} + \nu_AN_A^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_Y} & \frac{C_{AA}\beta_A\left (N_A^{(u)} + \nu_AN_A^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_A}
	\end{array}
	\right ).
\end{align}
The basic reproduction number is 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:sirs_R0}
R_0 = \frac{1}{2}\left (K_{YY} + K_{AA}\right ) + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(K_{YY} - K_{AA})^2 + 4K_{YA}K_{AY}}.
\end{align}

There are a few aspects of this expression that deserve to be highlighted in order to substantiate some of the choices we will make regarding model priors. First, it is possible for the outbreak to persist, i.e., $ R_0 > 1 $, even when the intrinsic reproduction number in one of the strata is below 1, e.g., $ K_{YY} <1$. However, a critical aspect of the contact structure is that most of the infectious contacts for each group are within--group contacts ($ C_{AA} = 0.6 $, $ C_{YY}=0.85 $). Therefore, the persistence of an outbreak in both strata suggests that $ K_{11} $ and $ K_{22} $ should not be much less than 1. If not, then persistence of transmission in the stratum where transmission is not self--sustained necessarily implies either highly elevated levels of infectious contact from outside the population ($ \alpha_j(t)N_j \gg 1 $ in our model), or a very high intrinsic reproduction number in the other stratum. This latter possibility could lead to unreasonably high attack rates in the other stratum.

Another point is that the basic reproduction number will be greater than the average of the intrinsic reproduction numbers, $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $, since the second term on the right hand side of (\ref{eqn:sirs_R0}) will typically be positive. Similarly, the variance of $ R_0 $ is also greater than the average of variances of $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $. For these reasons, it would not be appropriate to assign priors to $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $ without considering how they interact to induce a prior over $ R_0 $. Note that if the cross--stratum contact rates were negligible, $ R_0 $ would behave like the average of intrinsic reproduction number plus a term proportional to the absolute difference between $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $. This might suggest that a parameterization in terms of the average and difference of intrinsic reproduction numbers, or at least incorporating prior information about those quantities, could be appropriate. Note that our situation is more complicated since the cross stratum terms are not negligible ($ C_{AA} = 0.6 $, $ C_{YY}=0.85 $). Note that 
\begin{align*}
K_{YA} &= \frac{(1 - C_{YY})}{C_{YY}}\frac{\mu_Y}{\mu_A}K_{YY},\\
K_{AY} &= \frac{(1 - C_{AA})}{C_{AA}}\frac{\mu_A}{\mu_Y}K_{AA},\\
\implies K_{YA}K_{AY} &= \frac{(1 - C_{YY})(1-C_{AA})}{C_{YY}C_{AA}}K_{YY}K_{AA}.
\end{align*} 
Thus, $ R_0 $ behaves like the average of intrinsic reproductive numbers plus a term that is non--linear in $ K_{11} $ and $ K_{22} $.

Finally, the intrinsic reproduction numbers, and by extension $ R_0 $, are intrinsically tied to vaccine efficacy for susceptibility. It is critical that this be taken into account since
