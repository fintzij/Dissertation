\chapter{Models with Time--Varying Dynamics for Pandemic A(H1N1) Influenza in Finland}
\label{chap:lna_extensions}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:lna_extensions_overview}
To this point, we have largely worked with stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) where the transmission dynamics of an outbreak are time--homogeneous. This may be only mildly unreasonable for short outbreaks in closed, relatively ``well--mixed" populations, and is often an attractive modeling choice as SEMs with static dynamics are easier to interpret and fit. Incidence data typically arise in settings where the outbreak milieu changes with environmental factors, heterogeneity in the contact structures of various subpopulations as they are exposed, or behavioral responses as people become aware of an outbreak (or complacent about the extent to which it is under control). Furthermore, we are often interested in understanding the effects of time--varying interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, on the transmission dynamics of an outbreak. Thus, it is important to allow time--varying aspects of an outbreak to be flexibly expressed in the model.

In this chapter, we will use SEMs with time--varying force of infection (FOI) to model the spread of pandemic A(H1N1) influenza in Finland using surveillance data. Our goals will be to quantify the transmission dynamics of the outbreak, to estimate the true incidence, and to understand what effect a national vaccination campaign had in mitigating the outbreak severity. We will compare models with time--varying and constant dynamics that we fit using the linear noise approximation (LNA) framework developed in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems}.

\subsection{On the Importance of Allowing for Time--Varying Dynamics}
\label{subsec:tparam_motivation}

A critical aspect of modeling outbreaks over multiple seasons is that we must account for changes in rates of infectious contacts both within, and between, seasons. The decline in transmission at the end of one season may be attributable, in some combination, to stochastic extinction, a decline in the rate of infectious contact, and a reduction in the effective number of susceptible individuals via immunity acquired from natural exposure or vaccination. It is difficult to explain the emergence of the second season without allowing for stochastic reemergence, changes in the FOI, or waning immunity. Put another way, it is highly unlikely an outbreak that died off in a population protected by herd immunity would reemerge absent changes in FOI or repletion of susceptibles in the population. 

Before delving into details of how we intend to accommodate time--inhomogeneity in the FOI, we briefly highlight why we should bother. To make the point, we compare results for two SIRS models fit to incidence data from an outbreak with time--inhomogeneous dynamics. The data were simulated from an SIRS model where the rate of infectious contact varied sinusoidally over the course of two waves (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots}). While both models allowed for loss of immunity, the per--contact infectious rate was held constant in one model, and in the other was allowed to vary in time, with changes penalized via a first order Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) shrinkage prior (details presented in Sections \ref{sec:flu_tparam_models} and \ref{sec:tparam_motiv_details}). 

Although both models are misspecified vis--a--vis the  data generating model, the model with time--varying FOI was clearly better able to describe the dynamics of the outbreak (Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots}). Estimates of basic and effective reproduction numbers capture the true basic and effective reproduction numbers throughout both seasons. The model with time--varying FOI is also able to recover the true incidence. In contrast, the model with constant FOI fails to accurately estimate the basic and effective reproduction numbers between seasons and during the second wave. It also completely fails to capture the incidence during the second wave. Unlike the model with time--varying FOI, the model with constant FOI also fails to recover the hyperparameters governing the outbreak dynamics and sampling process. In particular the mean duration of immunity and case detection rate are important parameters that are poorly estimated (Figure \ref{fig:sinfoi_param_plots}). Finally, the posterior predictive distributions for the model with time--varying FOI are more accurate, and more precise, than posterior predictive distributions for the model with constant FOI (Figures \ref{fig:sinfoi_tparam_plots} and \ref{fig:sinfoi_ppi_comp}).

\section{Modeling the Spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Finland}
\label{sec:flu_tparam_models}

\subsection{Data and Vaccination}
\label{subsec:flu_datavacc}

We will model the time series of weekly incidence among youths (Y), ages 0--19, and adults (A), ages 20+, over a one year period beginning in epiweek 15, 2009, one month prior to the first observed case in the first season, and a 42 week period beginning in epiweek 33, 2010, corresponding to the start of the 2010--2011 Finnish school year \cite{calendarFinland}. Data from the inter--season period, epiweeks 15--32, 2010, were aggregated over the inter--season period and indexed at epiweek 33, 2010. We denote the data as, $$ \bY = \left (\left (Y_{Y,1},Y_{A,1}\right ),\dots,\left (Y_{Y,52},Y_{A,52}\right ),\left (Y^\prime_{Y,71},Y^\prime_{A,71}\right ),\dots,\left (Y_{Y,113},Y_{A,113}\right )\right ), $$ where the index corresponds to weeks elapsed from week zero, i.e., epiweek 15, 2009. The observed incidence in age--stratum $ j $ at week $ \ell $ is modeled as a negative binomial sample of the true incidence \begin{equation}
\label{flu_emit_prob}
Y_{j,\ell} \sim \mr{Neg.Binom}\left (\mu = \rho_j(\Delta N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) + \Delta N_{SI}^{(v)}(t_\ell)), \sigma^2 = \mu + \mu^2 / \phi_j\right ),
\end{equation}
where $ \rho_j $ is the age--specific mean case detection rate, $ \phi_j $ is an age--specific overdispersion parameter, and $ \Delta $ is a differencing operator for the cumulative incidence in a age--vaccination stratum, e.g., $ \Delta N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) = N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_\ell) - N_{SI}^{(u)}(t_{\ell-1}) $ is change in cumulative incidence between times $ t_{\ell-1} $ and $ t_\ell $. Note that the time--step for the data and incidence over the inter--season period is twenty weeks long.

\subsection{Model Structure}
\label{subsec:flu_modstructure}

We will use the LNA framework developed in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems} to fit an age--vaccination stratified susceptible--infected--recovered--susceptible (SIRS) model in which individuals transition stochastically, and continuously in time, between disease states. Individuals are assumed to become infectious immediately upon becoming infected, and acquire temporary, though potentially long lasting, protection upon recovery. Individuals who lose immunity are assumed to become fully susceptible. Following \cite{shubin2016revealing}, we assume a closed population and ignore demographic changes or mortality. All individuals were assigned to be susceptible and unvaccinated at the start of the modeling period. The model is diagrammed in Figure \ref{fig:flu_sirs_diag}, and Table \ref{tab:flu_notation} lists the model parameters and their interpretations.

By taking the sojourn time in each disease state to be exponentially distributed, and leveraging the exchangeability of individuals within the model, we represent the time--evolution of the epidemic as a Markov jump process (MJP), $$ \bX^c = \lbrace S_{Y}^{(u)}, I_{Y}^{(u)}, R_{Y}^{(u)},
S_{Y}^{(v)}, I_{Y}^{(v)}, R_{Y}^{(v)}, S_{A}^{(u)}, I_{A}^{(u)}, R_{A}^{(u)},
S_{A}^{(v)}, I_{A}^{(v)}, R_{A}^{(v)} \rbrace, $$ on the state space of compartment counts, $ \mcS_X^c$, with corresponding cumulative incidence process $ \bN^c $ on the state space of cumulative incidence counts $ \mcS_N^c $.

\end{figure}

The contact rate between individuals in age stratum $ j $ and age stratum $ k $, denoted $ C_{jk} $, was based on estimated mean contact rates, appropriately standardized (see Section \ref{sec:flu_contact_rates}), from the Finnish arm of the POLYMOD survey \cite{mossong2008social,polymod} and accessed via the \texttt{socialmixr R} package \cite{funk2018socialmixr}. Sixty percent of contacts in the 0--19 age group were from other individuals age 0--19, while eighty--five percent of the contacts in the 20+ age group were from other adults.  The rates, $ \blambda = (\blambda_{Y},\blambda_{A}) $, at which individuals in age--stratum $ j \in \lbrace Y,\ A\rbrace $ transition between disease states are
\begin{equation}\small
\label{eqn:flu_sirs_rates}
\blambda_{j} = \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{ll}
\lambda_{SI,j}^{(u)} = \left [\alpha_{j}(t) + \beta_{j}(t)\left (C_{jk}\left (I_{j}^{(u)} + I_{j}^{(v)}\right ) + (1-C_{jk})\left (I_{k}^{(u)} + I_{k}^{(v)}\right )\right )\right ]S_{j}^{u} \\ 
\lambda_{SI,j}^{(v)} = \nu\left [\alpha_{j}(t) + \beta_{j}(t)\left (C_{jk}\left (I_{j}^{(u)} + I_{j}^{(v)}\right ) + (1-C_{jk})\left (I_{k}^{(u)} + I_{k}^{(v)}\right )\right )\right ]S_{j}^{v}\\
\lambda_{IR,j}^{(u)} = \mu_{j} I_{j}^{(u)} \\
\lambda_{IR,j}^{(v)} = \mu_{j} I_{j}^{(v)} \\
\lambda_{RS,j}^{(u)} = \omega R_{j}^{(u)} \\
\lambda_{RS,j}^{(v)} = \omega R_{j}^{(v)}
\end{array}
\right .
\end{equation}

At weekly intervals, we deterministically force individuals from unvaccinated model compartments to the corresponding vaccinated compartments. Following \cite{shubin2016revealing}, we assume that vaccine doses were distributed proportionally to the number of individuals in each unvaccinated compartment of the corresponding age stratum. In \cite{shubin2016revealing}, it was assumed that vaccination was fully protective with 80\% probability two weeks after administration. Here, we will assume that the vaccine is partially protective in that it reduces the rate at which vaccinated individuals become infected. We do not assume that VE for susceptibility varies by age, and also do not model vaccine efficacy for infectiousness or recovery due to the limited extent of the data. To account for the time required to elicit an immune response, we apply the deterministic forcing at the beginning of week after the time when each dose count was indexed. Thus, suppose that at the end of week $ \ell $ we have $ \bX_j^{(u)}(t_\ell) = \left (S_j^{(u)}(t_\ell), I_j^{(u)}(t_\ell), R_j^{(u)}(t_\ell)\right ) $ unvaccinated susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in age stratum $ j $ and $ \bX_j^{(v)}(t_\ell) = \left (S_j^{(v)}(t_\ell), I_j^{(v)}(t_\ell), R_j^{(v)}(t_\ell)\right ) $ vaccinated individuals, and that $ V_j(t_\ell) $ vaccine doses were recorded for stratum $ j $ in that week. We apply the vaccine forcing to the initial state for the following week: 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:vacc_forcing}
\begin{split}
	\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell^+) &= \bX_j^{(u)}(t_\ell) - V_j(t_\ell)\frac{\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}{\sum\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}, \\
	\bX_{j}^{(v)}(t_\ell^+) &= \bX_j^{(v)}(t_\ell) + V_j(t_\ell)\frac{\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}{\sum\bX_{j}^{(u)}(t_\ell)}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Thus, the vaccination forcing affects the initial condition for the period $ (t_\ell,t_{\ell+1}] $, not the state at time $ t_\ell $. 

The diffusion approximation for the MJP is a real--valued process, $ \bX $, on the analogous state space of compartment volumes, $ \mcS_X^R $, and with corresponding cumulative incidence process, $ \bN $, with state space $ \mcS_N^R $. Note that the boundary conditions on the state spaces of $ \bX^c $ and $ \bN^c $, and similarly of $ \bX $ and $ \bN $, ensure positivity of compartment counts and monotonicity of cumulative incidence paths, and that the compartment counts each age--vaccination stratum sum to the number of individuals in that stratum, e.g., $ S_{Y}^{(u)}(t) + I_{Y}^{(u)}(t) + R_{Y}^{(u)}(t) = N_{Y}^{(u)}(t) $. As in Chapter \ref{chap:lna_for_sems}, we will use the non--centered parameterization of the restarting LNA of the log--transformed SDE to approximate the time--evolution of $ \bX^c $ and $ \bN^c $. Algorithm \ref{alg:doLNA2} details the procedure for mapping standard normal LNA draws onto an LNA sample path with vaccination forcings.

\subsubsection{Reproduction numbers}
\label{subsubsec:stratmod_repnumbs}
The basic reproduction number, $ R_0 $, and its variants describe the propensity of an outbreak to spread through a population \cite{heffernan2005perspectives,van2008further}. $ R_0 $ is loosely interpreted as the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. An outbreak will fail to sustain itself (almost surely when it evolves deterministically, but in reality with high probability due to the inherently stochastic nature of epidemics) when $ R_0 < 1 $. For this reason, epidemiologists often quantify the effectiveness of a control measure by estimating the extent to which the intervention reduces $ R_0 $. We can interpret the basic reproduction number as an intrinsic reproduction number when there is an exogenous contribution to force of infection \cite{blackwood2018introduction}. From a modeling perspective, is important to understand not only how $ R_0 $ affects the transmission dynamics, but also how various aspects of the model interact to affect $ R_0 $. 

The basic reproduction number of a structured SEM can be obtained by computing the spectral radius (absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue) of the next generation matrix (NGM) for the linearized system of ODEs specifying the flow in and out of states at infection \cite{heffernan2005perspectives,van2017reproduction,van2008further}. The $ i,j $ element of the NGM gives the expected number of secondary infections in age stratum $ i $ given an index infection in stratum $ j $. Noting that vaccinated and unvaccinated invididuals in this model are equally transmissive and have the same mean infectious period durations, we obtain the age--structured next generation matrix
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:sirs_ngm_full}
\bK &= 
	\left (
	\begin{array}{cc}
	K_{YY} & K_{YA} \\
	K_{AY} & K_{AA}
	\end{array}
	\right ) =\left (
	\begin{array}{cc}
	\frac{C_{YY}\beta_Y\left (N_Y^{(u)} + \nu_YN_Y^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_Y} & \frac{C_{YA}\beta_Y\left (N_Y^{(u)} + \nu_YN_Y^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_A} \\[2ex]
	\frac{C_{AY}\beta_A\left (N_A^{(u)} + \nu_AN_A^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_Y} & \frac{C_{AA}\beta_A\left (N_A^{(u)} + \nu_AN_A^{(v)}\right )}{\mu_A}
	\end{array}
	\right ).
\end{align}
The basic reproduction number is 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:sirs_R0}
R_0 = \frac{1}{2}\left (K_{YY} + K_{AA}\right ) + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(K_{YY} - K_{AA})^2 + 4K_{YA}K_{AY}}.
\end{align}

There are a few aspects of this expression that we should highlight. First, it is possible for the outbreak to persist, i.e., $ R_0 > 1 $, even when the intrinsic reproduction number in one of the strata is below 1, e.g., $ K_{YY} <1$. However, a critical aspect of the contact structure is that most of the infectious contacts for each group are within--group contacts ($ C_{YY} = 0.6 $, $ C_{AA}=0.85 $). Therefore, the persistence of an outbreak in both strata suggests that $ K_{11} $ and $ K_{22} $ should not be much less than one. If not, then persistence of the outbreak in the stratum where transmission is not self--sustained implies that either its rate of infectious contact from outside the population is high ($ \alpha_j(t)N_j \gg  1$), and/or that the intrinsic reproduction number in the other stratum is high. This latter possibility could be particularly problematic since it might imply unreasonably high attack rates in the other stratum.

We also note that the basic reproduction number is greater than the average of intrinsic reproduction numbers, $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $, since the second term on the right hand side of (\ref{eqn:sirs_R0}) will typically be positive. Similarly, the variance of $ R_0 $ is also greater than the average of variances of $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $. For these reasons, we should consider how $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $ interact to a prior over $ R_0 $ when parameterizing the model. Note that if the cross--stratum contact rates were negligible, $ R_0 $ would behave like the average of intrinsic reproduction numbers plus a term proportional to the absolute difference between $ K_{YY} $ and $ K_{AA} $. This suggests that prior information about the intrinsic reproduction numbers, either individually (our preference) or about their average and difference, could help identify $ R_0 $. We should also keep in mind that our model is more complicated since the cross stratum terms are not negligible ($ C_{AA} = 0.6 $, $ C_{YY}=0.85 $), hence
\begin{align*}
K_{YA} &= \frac{(1 - C_{YY})}{C_{YY}}\frac{\mu_Y}{\mu_A}K_{YY},\hspace{0.25in}
K_{AY} = \frac{(1 - C_{AA})}{C_{AA}}\frac{\mu_A}{\mu_Y}K_{AA},\\
&\implies K_{YA}K_{AY} = \frac{(1 - C_{YY})(1-C_{AA})}{C_{YY}C_{AA}}K_{YY}K_{AA}.
\end{align*} 
Thus, $ R_0 $ behaves like the average of intrinsic reproduction numbers plus a term that is non--linear in $ K_{11} $ and $ K_{22} $.

Finally we emphasize the importance of accounting for all of the parameters that contribute the intrinsic reproduction numbers, and by extension $ R_0 $, when specifying priors and parameterizing the estimation scale of the MCMC. In particular, it is critical to note that the effective population size might be lower than the nominal population size because of vaccination and depletion of susceptibles. We can easily misspecify the scales of prior distributions for the reproduction numbers, or select an inefficient parameterization for the MCMC estimation scale, by neglecting this dynamic. In our model, for example, the value of $ R_0 $ in the first season, and the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity, will affect the effective population size at the beginning of the second season. 

\subsection{Flexible Models for the Force of Infection with Gaussian Markov Random Fields}
\label{subsec:flu_gmrf}

We will model the time--varying force of infection using first order GMRFs (random walk of order 1; RW1) for the log intrinsic reproduction numbers and the effective rate of exogenous infectious contacts in each age stratum. The GMRFs are separately specified over three epochs corresponding to the period one month before the first detected case until the start of the Finnish school year in 2009, the beginning of the Finnish school year in 2009 until its start in 2010 (including the inter--season period), and the second epidemic season beginning at the start of the Finnish school year, 2010. These epochs correspond to epiweeks 15, 2009 through epiweek 33, 2009, epiweek 34, 2009 through epiweek 32, 2010, and epiweek 33, 2010 through epiweek 22, 2011. We will assume that the intrinsic reproduction numbers are homogeneous over the inter--season period, from epiweek 16, 2010 -- epiweek 32, 2010.

The GMRF is parameterized on the log scale using a state--space formulation defined by the initial value and first order differences. Let $ \bpsi_{j} = \lbrace\psi_{j,\ell}:\ \ell \in 0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112\rbrace $ be the vector of intrinsic reproduction numbers, ignoring relative contact rates, for stratum $ j \in \lbrace Y,A \rbrace$, and where time is indexed from epiweek 15, 2009. Let $ \bP^v_j = \left (P^v_j(t_1),\dots,P^v_j(t_L)\right )$ denote the vector of vaccine coverage rates for stratum $ j $. Absent vaccination,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:R0t_novacc}
\psi^\prime_{j,\ell} = \frac{\beta_j(t_\ell)N_j}{\mu_j},
\end{equation}
where $ \beta(t_\ell) $ is the time--varying rate of infection rate per--endogenous contact, $ \mu_j$ is the recovery rate at week $ \ell $ (season--specific), and $ N_{j} $ is the number of individuals in age stratum $ j $. Accounting for vaccination, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:R0t_vacc}
\psi_{j,\ell} = \frac{\beta_j(t_\ell)N_j\left (1 - P^v_j(t_\ell) + P^v_j(t_\ell)\nu_j\right )}{\mu_j}
\end{equation}
Note that $ \psi_{j,\ell}^\prime = \bpsi_{j,\ell} / \left (1 - P^v_j(t_\ell) + P^v_j(t_\ell)\right ) $. In order to capture the time--varying aspects of the force of infection that are not due to changes in vaccination, we will parameterize the GMRF for the force of infection using (\ref{eqn:R0t_novacc}). However, when we back out the time--varying rates of infectious contact, we need to account for the effects of vaccination that appear in (\ref{eqn:R0t_vacc}). Thus, $ \bpsi_j^\prime\sim \mr{GMRF}(\btheta) \implies\bpsi_j / (1 - \bP^v_j + \bP^v_j\nu_j) \sim \mr{GMRF}(\btheta). $

We denote by $ \Delta $ the first--order forward difference operator, i.e., $ \Delta X_j = X_{j+1} - X_j $. The first--order differences of the log intrinsic reproduction numbers for stratum $ j $ in each season are assigned a Gaussian prior with mean zero and variance $ \sigma^2_{j,\ell} $. We assign Gaussian priors to the initial intrinsic reproduction numbers at the beginning of each season and to the log standard deviation of the log differences in each season. The sub--model for intrinsic reproduction numbers in stratum $ j $ is
\begin{small}
	\begin{align}
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(\mu_{j,\ell},\tau_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell= 0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	\log(\sigma_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(m_{j,\ell}, s_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell=0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,0}),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,18}),&\ &\ell=18,\dots,51, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,71}),&\ &\ell=71,\dots,111, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,0}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,k}),&\ &\ell = 1,\dots,17, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,18}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,18+k}),&\ &\ell = 19,\dots,52, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,71}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,71+k}),&\ &\ell = 72,\dots,112. \nonumber \\
	\beta_j(t_\ell) &= \psi_{j,\ell}N_j/\left (\mu_{j}(t_\ell)(1 - P^v_j(t_\ell) + P_j^v(t_\ell)\nu_j)\right ),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112. \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{small}
In practice, we will use the following partially non--centered parameterization:
\begin{small}
	\begin{align}
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(\mu_{j,\ell},\tau_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell= 0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	Z_{\log(\sigma_{j,\ell})} &\sim \mcN(0,1),&\ &\ell=0,18,71, \nonumber \\
	Z_{\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})} &\sim \mcN(0,1),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16,18,\dots,51,71,\dots,111, \nonumber \\ 
	\log(\sigma_{j,\ell}) &= m_{j,\ell} + s_{j,\ell}Z_{\log(\sigma_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell = 0,18,71,\nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,0} Z_{\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,18} Z_{\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=18,\dots,51, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,71} Z_{\Delta\log(\psi_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=71,\dots,111, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,0}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,k}),&\ &\ell = 1,\dots,17, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,18}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,18+k}),&\ &\ell = 19,\dots,52, \nonumber\\
	\log(\psi_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\psi_{j,71}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\psi_{j,71+k}),&\ &\ell = 72,\dots,112. \nonumber \\
	\beta_j(t_\ell) &= \psi_{j,\ell}N_j/\left (\mu_{j}(t_\ell)(1 - P^v_j(t_\ell) + P_j^v(t_\ell)\nu_j)\right ),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112. \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{small}
We similarly assign a first order random walk prior to the effective number of exogenous infectious contacts for each age stratum. Note that this term is somewhat of a catch--all for infectious contacts that arise outside of the density dependent mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. The rate of exogenous infection may be loosely interpreted as either the baseline rate of infectious contact or as the rate of infection from outside the population. Let $ \alpha^\prime_{j,\ell} = \alpha_{j,\ell}N $ denote the rate of exogenous infection for age stratum $ j $ in week $ \ell $, scaled by the population size. The GMRF prior for $ \balpha^\prime_j = \lbrace\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}:\ \ell=0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112\rbrace $ is
\begin{small}
	\begin{align}
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(\mu_{j,\ell},\tau_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell= 0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	\log(\sigma_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(m_{j,\ell}, s_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell=0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,0}),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,18}),&\ &\ell=18,\dots,51, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&\sim \mcN(0, \sigma^2_{j,71}),&\ &\ell=71,\dots,111, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,0}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,k}),&\ &\ell = 1,\dots,17, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,18}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,18+k}),&\ &\ell = 19,\dots,52, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,71}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,71+k}),&\ &\ell = 72,\dots,112. \nonumber \\
	\alpha_{j,\ell} &= \alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}/N,&\ &\ell=0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112. \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{small}

Again, we will use a partially non--centered parameterization in practice.
\begin{small}
	\begin{align}
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &\sim \mcN(\mu_{j,\ell},\tau_{j,\ell}^2),&\ &\ell= 0,18,71, \nonumber\\
	Z_{\log(\sigma_{j,\ell})} &\sim \mcN(0,1),&\ &\ell=0,18,71, \nonumber \\
	Z_{\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})} &\sim \mcN(0,1),&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16,18,\dots,51,71,\dots,111, \nonumber \\ 
	\log(\sigma_{j,\ell}) &= m_{j,\ell} + s_{j,\ell}Z_{\log(\sigma_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell = 0,18,71,\nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,0} Z_{\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=0,\dots,16, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,18} Z_{\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=18,\dots,51, \nonumber\\
	\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})&= \sigma_{j,71} Z_{\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell})},&\ &\ell=71,\dots,111, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,0}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,k}),&\ &\ell = 1,\dots,17, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,18}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,18+k}),&\ &\ell = 19,\dots,52, \nonumber\\
	\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}) &= \log(\alpha^\prime_{j,71}) + \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1}\Delta\log(\alpha^\prime_{j,71+k}),&\ &\ell = 72,\dots,112. \nonumber \\
	\alpha_{j,\ell} &= \alpha^\prime_{j,\ell}/N,&\ &\ell=0,\dots,52,71,\dots,112 \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{small}

The initial reproduction numbers, for which we retain the centered parameterization, are blocked with other model parameters and updated using a multivariate normal slice sampler (MVNSS). The non--centered GMRF differences and their standard deviations are updated jointly with the LNA path using elliptical slice sampling (Algorithm \ref{alg:elliptss_lna_gmrf}). Readers familiar with GMRFs will note the, somewhat unconventional, Gaussian prior for the standard deviation of the random walk increments. This choice was made for computational reasons in order to facilitate joint updates of the GMRF and its hyper--parameters. Alternating between field and hyper--parameter updates is known to results in poorly mixing MCMC chains as large updates to the hyper--parameters quickly result in fields that are not concordant with the data  \cite{knorr2002block,murray2010hyper}. 

\subsection{Sampling from the Posterior}
\label{subsec:flu_model}

Let $ \bZ = \left (\bZ^X,\bZ^F,\bZ^{\btheta_F}\right ) $ denote the vector of i.i.d. standard normal draws for the LNA, GMRF increments, and GMRF hyperparameters, and let $ \pi(\btheta) $ be the prior distributions for the other model parameters. Let $ \mathcal{T} = \lbrace t_\ell:\ \ell = 1,\dots,52,71,\dots,113 \rbrace $ denote the set of observation times. Our MCMC will target the posterior
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:flu_posterior}
\pi(\btheta,\bZ | \bY) &\propto \pi(\bZ)\pi(\btheta)\pi(\bY|\btheta,\bZ) \nonumber\\
&= \pi(\bZ)\pi(\btheta) \prod_{t_\ell\in\mathcal{T}}\prod_{j\in\lbrace Y,A\rbrace} \Pr\left (Y_{j}(t_\ell) | \doLNA2(\bZ,\btheta,\mcI,\bxi)\right )
\end{align}
MCMC proceeds by alternately updating $ \bZ|\bY,\btheta $ using ElliptSS (Algorithm \ref{alg:elliptss_lna_gmrf}) and MVNSS updates for $ \btheta|\bY,\bZ $ (Algorithm \ref{alg:mvnss}). 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:flu_results}

\subsection{Incidence}
\label{subsec:flu_incid_res}
Estimates of cumulative incidence and attack rates by season and age group are reported in Table \ref{tab:flu_attack_rates}. The pandemic severity appears to be belied by the relatively low levels of mild cases that were detected by the surveillance system. We estimate that there were approximately 1.1 million (95\% BCI: 768,000, 1,540,000) infections in the first epidemic season, and an additional 810,000 (95\% BCI: 619,000, 1,050,000) cases during the second season. These estimates correspond to estimated attack rates of 14.3\%--28.7\% during the first season, and 11.6\%--19.5\% in the second season, assuming that each individual was infected only once. The estimated attack rates were substantially higher among youths than adults in the first epidemic season, but somewhat lower during the second season. The estimated incidence over the inter--season period was low; 17 cases (95\% BCI: 8, 37) among youths, and 87 cases (95\% BCI: 35, 222) among adults.
